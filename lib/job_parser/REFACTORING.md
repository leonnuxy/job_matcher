# Job Parser Refactoring - May 5, 2025

## Changes Made

1. **Modularized Job Parser**
   - Split functionality into specialized modules:
     - `extract_description.py`: For job description extraction
     - `extract_requirements.py`: For skills/requirements extraction
     - `extract_location.py`: For location extraction
     - `parser_utils.py`: For shared utilities and constants
   
2. **Fixed RegEx Patterns**
   - Replaced problematic variable-width look-behind patterns in location extraction with capturing groups
   - Enhanced skill detection patterns to include PostgreSQL

3. **Code Organization**
   - Moved stop words list to a central location in parser_utils.py
   - Created consistent interfaces across modules
   - Improved error handling and logging
   - Added documentation

## Testing

New test script created: `tests/scripts/test_job_parser_refactored.py`

## Next Steps

1. Add more specialized extractors (salary, job title, etc.)
2. Enhance text preprocessing for better recognition accuracy
3. Consider adding model-based classification for job requirements
4. Update test coverage to include the new module structure
