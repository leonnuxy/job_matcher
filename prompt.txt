     - Use its `title`, `company`, and the `year` if provided (omit year if not).
     - Under the title line, add a single bullet using its `description`.
     - On the next line, list its `skills` in square brackets.
   - Do **not** add any other sections or explanatory text to the resume part.

     - Express enthusiasm for collaborating with their team or learning about their domain
     - Include a brief closing paragraph that expresses interest in further discussion
     - Use proper spacing around salutations and signatures
