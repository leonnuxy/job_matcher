Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Full-Stack Engineer position at Proof, as advertised on LinkedIn job board. My experience in full-stack development, coupled with my expertise in building scalable and reliable systems using Python and React, aligns perfectly with the requirements outlined in the job description. Furthermore, my proficiency in utilizing CI/CD pipelines to automate deployment and ensure high-quality code delivery directly addresses your need for a continuously delivered and stable platform.

Throughout my career, I have consistently demonstrated the ability to design and implement high-performing backend services, as evidenced by my work at APEGA where I migrated 30+ Java microservices to a more efficient architecture, resulting in a 35% reduction in build times. My experience at Spartan Controls showcases my skills in developing responsive and user-friendly front-end applications using React and TypeScript, implementing AI-based anomaly detection that reduced unplanned downtime. This experience is directly transferable to Proof's platform, enabling me to collaborate effectively with engineers, designers, and product managers to architect and maintain high-quality full-stack features.

My commitment to continuous improvement is reflected in my proactive approach to staying updated on industry trends and incorporating new technologies to enhance team productivity and system robustness. I am confident that my skills and passion for building innovative, high-impact software solutions make me an ideal candidate for this position.

Sincerely,

Noel Ugwoke
