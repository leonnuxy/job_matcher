Dear Hiring Team at Glia,



I am excited to apply for the Full-Stack Software Engineer position at Glia. With over four years of experience building scalable web applications and microservices using JavaScript, Node.js, and Python, I am eager to contribute to Glia’s mission of enhancing customer experiences through Conversational AI.

At APEGA, I designed and maintained Node.js microservices on AWS, improving service reliability by 30% and integrating Datadog for real-time monitoring that reduced incident response times by 40%. I collaborated closely with product and design teams to define and implement RESTful APIs, delivering high-quality features within agile sprints.

In my role at Spartan Controls, I developed React components and Node.js backends for IoT dashboards, increasing user engagement by 40%. I also automated our CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and Jenkins, enabling daily deployments with a <1% rollback rate. My commitment to writing well-tested, maintainable code and mentoring peers aligns with Glia’s culture of quality and collaboration.

I am excited about joining Team Locus to contribute to the design, development, and deployment of complex software solutions. My expertise in JavaScript, Python, Node.js, React, and AWS, along with my passion for learning

Best Regards,
Noel Ugwoke
