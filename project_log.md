"content": "## Implement Google Custom Search Engine (CSE) Integration\n\nImplemented the `search_jobs` function in `lib/api_calls.py` using the Google CSE API. The function supports search queries, API key, CSE ID, and a configurable max age for job postings. Results are returned as a list of dictionaries with 'title', 'link', and 'snippet'. Error handling and logging are included.\n\n---\n\n### Features\n- Accepts search query, API key, CSE ID, and max age (in hours) for job postings.\n- Returns up to 10 results per search.\n- Handles API errors and logs them.\n- Results are sorted by similarity to the resume.\n\n---\n\n### Testing\n- Unit tests verify valid/invalid API key handling, correct field extraction, and result structure.\n- Live test verifies integration with real API key and CSE ID.\n\n---\n\n### Author\nNoel\n\n### Tags\nsearch, google-cse, api, python\n\n---\n\n"id": 2,\n"title": "Resume Text Extraction and Skill Extraction",\n"content": "## Resume Text Extraction and Skill Extraction\n\nImplemented `extract_resume_text` in `lib/resume_parser.py` to read and return the contents of a resume file.
