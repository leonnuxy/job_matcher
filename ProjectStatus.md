# Job Matcher Project Status

## Current Status

As of May 10, 2025, the project has the following completed components:

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Job search via Google Custom Search API
- ✅ Job description parsing and skill extraction
- ✅ Resume parsing and skill extraction
- ✅ Similarity calculation between resume and job postings
- ✅ ATS simulation to provide realistic scoring
- ✅ Resume optimization recommendations
- ✅ Gemini AI integration for advanced resume optimization
- ✅ LinkedIn job analysis and integration
- ✅ LinkedIn guest API support for job details retrieval

### Infrastructure
- ✅ Modular design with separation of concerns
- ✅ Consolidated and organized test suite
- ✅ Simple ATS comparison tool for testing
- ✅ Error handling and logging
- ✅ Configuration management
- ✅ Unified CLI system with subcommands
- ✅ LinkedIn-specific service module

## Recent Updates

- Created a dedicated `services/linkedin.py` module that isolates LinkedIn-specific functionality
- Refactored `process_linkedin_job.py` to use the new LinkedIn service module
- Added tests for LinkedIn service functionality
- Implemented a unified command-line interface (CLI) with subcommands
- Added Google Generative AI (Gemini) for intelligent resume optimization
- Consolidated test suite for better organization and less redundancy
- Implemented robust ATS simulation logic that provides consistent scoring
- Added skill matching and detailed analysis of missing skills
- Fixed spaCy model loading issues with graceful fallbacks

## Next Steps

- [ ] Further enhance the testing suite with more test cases
- [ ] Improve error handling and robustness in LinkedIn API integration
- [ ] Extend the unified CLI system with more advanced filtering options
- [ ] Implement web interface for easier interaction with consistent UI
- [ ] Add job tracking and application management features  
- [ ] Integrate with more job search APIs for expanded coverage
- [ ] Create dashboard for visualizing job match statistics
- [ ] Build email notification system for new high-matching jobs
- [ ] Implement database storage for persistent data and job tracking

## Dependencies

Make sure to install all required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And download the necessary spaCy model:
```
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## Environment Setup

Required environment variables:
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` - Google Custom Search API key
- `GOOGLE_CSE_ID` - Custom Search Engine ID
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY` - AI provider API key for resume optimization
- `LLM_PROVIDER` - Set to "openai" or "gemini" to select the AI provider

Optional environment variables:
- `SIMULATION_MODE` - Set to "1" to run in simulation mode without making API calls
- `LINKEDIN_API_DELAY` - Delay between LinkedIn API calls (default: 3 seconds)
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Google Gemini AI API key

## Known Issues

- Resume optimization may fail if Gemini API key is not set or invalid
- Some JavaScript-heavy job posting sites may not parse correctly
